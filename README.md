Pattern Lab Fluid Edition: Starter Kit
======================================

This package is a starter kit for the design tool [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io). The package consists of dummy
template files which can be used for kickstarting Pattern Lab with a collection of assets and templates.

**Do not install this package manually - it should always be installed via the [Pattern Lab Fluid Edition](https://github.com/NamelessCoder/patternlab-fluid-editiion)**

This work was kindly sponsored by [Busy Noggin](http://busynoggin.com/).
